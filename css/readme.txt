CSS Readme

The css files in here serve as EXAMPLES. 

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you use these as a starting point, 
and create your own individual styling in your theme's style.css file.
OR at the very least, copy the listings* and img directory to your
theme directory and then add 
@import "listings.css";
to your style.css file, and then tweak as needed

To have these stylesheets included when needed, check the appropriate box
in the admin screen: Real Estate / Settings 
"Add Plugin CSS"

But it's much better to have your own styles in your theme, and
we recommend that you DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES HERE becauseyour changes may
be overwritten or lost when you upgrade this plugin in the future.

For general styling:
listings.css

For the tabbed interface on the Listings Page:
listings.tabs.css - imported by listings.css
img/tabs.png - the colored tabs

--------------------------------------
Note: the following files will always be used on the Edit Page admin screen:

For the admin datepicker:
ui.datepicker.css
